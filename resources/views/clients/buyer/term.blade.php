                    <p><strong>2.4 Other similar technologies</strong></p>
                    <p>DPAPI (Data Protection Application Programming Interface) is a simple cryptographic application
                        programming interface available as a built-in component in Windows 2000 and later versions of
                        Microsoft Windows operating systems. In theory the Data Protection API can enable symmetric
                        encryption of any kind of data; in practice, its primary use in the Windows operating system is
                        to perform symmetric encryption of asymmetric private keys, using a user or system secret as a
                        significant contribution of entropy. DPAPI can help record and store users&rsquo; personal
                        data.Data Cube is a simple application for record and analyze personal data. If you choose to
                        reject cookies, as noted above, you may not be able to use certain features of our websites and
